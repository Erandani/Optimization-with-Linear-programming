# Optimization-with-Linear-programming


We can find the optimum advertising mix by formulating the problem as a linear optimization problem. The objective function would represent the total cost or profit associated with the advertising mix, and the constraints would represent the various resource limitations, such as budget and available media.

The decision variables would represent the amounts of each advertising medium to be used, and the objective function and constraints would be expressed as linear equations or inequalities. The solution to the linear program would then provide the optimal values for the decision variables, which correspond to the optimal advertising mix.
